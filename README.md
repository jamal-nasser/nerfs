## Welcome to nerfs!

nerfs is an e-commerce website for selling products online. With many bussinesses going online last year due to the pandameic, I saw an opportunity to build this project.

When users visit the webiste, they will scroll through a selection of electronic devices, see the prices, details and reviews other customers left on the products.

If they like something, they will add it to their cart and checkout to make the payment.

The website also has an admin page that allows the business owner to add products, keep track of the stock count...

### Technologies used:

* Javascript, React, Nodejs, Expressjs, MongoDB, React Bootstrap

P.S: The project is under development (65%)
